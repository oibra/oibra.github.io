This app is built around the style guidelines for CSE 14X (Intro to computer programming 1 & 2 at the university of washington) with those students as the primary audience, but should be a helpful resource for any novice Java learners.</p>

            <p>i am currently the head ta of cse 142 at the university of washington. i've been a ta in the allen school at the university of washington for 2.5 years, mostly teaching intro programming courses, but i've also taught our programming languages course. i'm really passionate about introductory computer science, equitable cs pedagogy, and equitable cs outreach -- dealing with diversity/inclusion/equity problems in the cs world and cs spaces.</p>

                <p>a course on basic procedural programming, as well as introductory object-oriented programming concepts. i've taught this course for 6 terms as a teaching assistant. in that time, i've lead exploration sessions where we host talks on a wide variety of computing topics for intro students, and served as head ta and hosted class on occassion.</p>

                <p>the allen school's course on programming languages. it explores a variety of programming language topics by studying functional programming languages, static- and dynamicly-typed languages, and loose- and strict-typed languages, through the lenses of SML, racket, and ruby. i taught this course for one term, and I think it's a super fun exploration into the mechanics of programming languages. if you're a cse student at uw, i highly recommend this class!/p>
