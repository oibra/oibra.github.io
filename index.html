  <h2>about me</h2>
  <p>i'm omar ("OH-mar", or əʊmɑr in IPA), and I'm a <strong>lecturer for the <a href="https://cs.uic.edu/" class="link">department of computer science</a> at the <a href="https://www.uic.edu/" class="link">university of illinois chicago</a></strong>. i earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the paul g. allen school of computer science at the university of washington in 2021 and 2023 respectively. while I was there, I helped teach computer science courses, taught my own courses, and completed my master's thesis on methods for teaching proof-writing advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rtweber2/" target="_blank">Robbie Weber</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bricker/" target="_blank">Lauren Bricker</a>. I also am very anti capital letters, as you might be able to glean from this site.</p>
