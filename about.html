  <p>hi! i'm omar ("OH-mar", or əʊmɑr in IPA), and I'm a lecturer for the department of computer science at the university of illinois chicago.</p> 
  
  <p>previously, i earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the paul g. allen school of computer science at the university of washington in 2021 and 2023 respectively. while I was there, I helped teach computer science courses, taught my own courses, and completed my master's thesis on methods for teaching proof-writing advised by Robbie Weber and Lauren Bricker. I also am very anti capital letters, as you might be able to glean from this site.</p>

  <p>currently, i am teaching a number of cs theory courses at uic, and i help to manage our undergraduate ta program. i'm also deeply interested in work on embedding ethics into computer science curriculums.</p>
